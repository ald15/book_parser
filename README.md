# book_parser
<b>Book parser</b>

<pre>It allows you to download books from sites that are protected from downloading 
books and only allow them to be read on the site (view one page of the book).
This parser simulates the user's actions - flipping through the book, 
saves the read text in html format along with links to illustrations, 
simultaneously saving links to the illustrations themselves for their subsequent download.</pre>
